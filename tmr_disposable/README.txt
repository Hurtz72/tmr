Tao Modular Realism: Disposable Launchers
README
-------------------------------

This module adds new behavior for single-shot launchers such as the PCML. After firing, they cannot be reloaded. Whether they should be thrown away or not is left up to the player. Any extra ammo carried by the player serves no purpose.
