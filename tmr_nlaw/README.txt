Tao Modular Realism: PCML Attack & Guidance
README
-------------------------------

This module enhances the PCML with NLAW/SRAW attack and guidance characteristics.
The PCML is split into two variants, PCML AT (EFP) and PCML MPV (multi-purpose frag).
The EFP AT version uses overfly top attack.

When using the PCML, hold your "Lock Targets" key (default Tab) and track the moving target
if you would like to apply Predicted Line of Sight guidance. Be sure not to release
the key until the missile has been fired.
