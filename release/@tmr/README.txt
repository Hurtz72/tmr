Tao Modular Realism
README
-------------------------------

Tutorials are included -- check the 'Scenarios' menu to learn the new features of TMR.

You may use any combination of modules that you'd like, except for modules beginning with 'tmr_u'. These 'unified' modules tie everything together and depend on other modules to do things like set loadouts and crate contents.
