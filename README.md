_If you're a developer:_
TMR is licensed under the GNU GPL v2, and you're welcome to contribute with code, bug reports, and ideas.

I, Taosenai, do maintain full control of this repository though, and a submission doesn't guarantee inclusion. I have a specific vision for TMR and I will follow through on it. But you are, of course, welcome to fork TMR and maintain your own variation!

TMR uses Git to manage its code, but if you're unfamiliar with the Git VCS, you can just send your changes to me via email and I'll integrate them myself.
